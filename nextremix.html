            <h1>What is NextRemix?</h1>
            <p>Kai and her friends (including Fivnex co-workers) have decided that they wanted to start helping the community, by working with the community on new remixes aimed to be flavors. We also are working on brining back extinct OS projects, including Kai's three places in the discontinued section. The aim of NextRemix is to start providing the Ubuntu community with more desktop options, making it easier for the end user to have whatever desktop they want.</p>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>Currently, that is a secret. However, NextRemix will replace the "Build Your Own Remix" section.</p>
